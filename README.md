###How does it Work?

Once SocialAuth Android is integrated into your application, following is the authentication process:

 * User opens the app and chooses the provider to request the authentication by using SocialAuth-android library.
 *  User is redirected to Facebook, Twitter or other provider's login site by library where they enter their credentials.
 *  Upon successful login, provider asks for userâ€™s permission to share their basic data with your app.
 * Once user accepts it,On successful authentication the library redirects user to app.
 * Now user can call SocialAuth Android library to get information about user profile, gets contacts list or share status to friends.
